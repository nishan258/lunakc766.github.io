My name is Luna KC. I’m an Assistant Professor in Global and International Studies at the Faculty of Indigenous Studies, Social Sciences and Humanities, UNBC. Prior to joining UNBC, I was a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Max Bell School of Public Policy, McGill University. I also lectured at the School of Public Policy and Global Affairs, University of British Columbia. I earned my PhD (2019) and master’s degree (2011), both in International Development Studies (with a focus on conflict, security, disaster, and public policy), from Wageningen University, the Netherlands. My work is interdisciplinary and transnational, situated at the nexus of gender, armed conflict, women, peace, and security (WPS), cybersecurity, technology-facilitated violence, and disasters. I have area specialties in South Asia, Southeast Asia, and North America. Furthermore, I have worked and provided advice in various organizations, including Plan International, Canadian Research Institute for the Advancement of Women, Women Transforming Cities, National Defence Canada, and the Asian Development Bank. I am also a research co-lead at the Research Network on Women, Peace and Security. I love reading, hiking, and cooking my favorite dishes when not working.
